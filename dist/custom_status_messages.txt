So close, your hand in mine
Green threads fall deeper inside
You move through my veins
You move through every part of me (Pretty harsh)
Take you to places no one knows to find relief
I will always love you
I will always love you
You grew, got through my sight
Oh, my timing left to fight, ooh
Drained out of every part of me (Pretty harsh)
When I think if you would change your mind and leave, ooh
See upcoming rock shows
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause there's no one else above you
Love me again
Love me again
