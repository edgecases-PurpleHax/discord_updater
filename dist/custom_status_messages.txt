I've tried, tried, tried, and I’ve tried even more
I've cried, cried, cried, and I can't recall what for
I’ve pressed, I've pushed, I've yelled, I've begged
In hopes of some success
But the inevitable fact is that it never will impress!
I've no more fucks to give
My fucks have runneth dry
I've tried to go fuck shopping but there's no fucks left to buy!
I've no more fucks to give
Though more fucks I’ve tried to get
I’m over my fuck budget, and I'm now in fucking debt!
I strive, strive, strive, to get everything done
I’ve played by all the rules, but I've very rarely won
I've smiled, I've charmed, I’ve wooed and laughed, alas to no avail
I've run round like a moron, to unequivocally fail!
I've no more fucks to give
My fuck fuse has just blown
I've been hunting for my fucks all day but they've upped and fucked off home!
I've no more fucks to give
My fuck rations are depleted
I've rallied my fuck army but it's been fucking defeated!
The effort has just not been worth the time or the expense!
I've exhausted all my energy, for minimal recompense!
The distinct lack of acknowledgement has now begun to gall!
And I've come to realize that I don't give a fuck at all!
I've no more fucks to give
My fucks have flown away
My fucks are now so fucked off they've refused to fucking stay!
I've no more fucks to give
My fucks have gone insane
They've come back round and passed me while they're fucking off again!
I've no more fucks to give
My fucks have all dissolved
I've planned many projects, but my fucks won't be involved!
I've no more fucks to give
My fucks have all been spent
They've fucked off from the building and I don't know where they went!
I've no more fucks to give!
I've no more fucks to give!
I've no more fucks!
I've no more fucks!
I've no more fucks to give!
